# Learnings Index

Cross-cutting patterns learned in this codebase. Updated via `/compound`.

## Recent Learnings

<!-- /compound adds recent learnings here - newest first -->

_No learnings yet. Run `/compound` at the end of implementation sessions._

## How This Works

1. **Feature-specific learnings** → Go in the spec file's `## Learnings` section
2. **Cross-cutting learnings** → Go in category files below
3. **General patterns** → Go in `general.md`

The `/compound` command analyzes your session and routes learnings to the right place.
